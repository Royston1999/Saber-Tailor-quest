# SaberTailor
A basic port of the SaberTailor mod for the Oculus Quest platform

This mod also includes a port [Kinsi](https://github.com/kinsi55)'s ControllerSettingsHelper mod

## SaberTailor Features
Customise your controller settings for each hand independently!
- Import your current setings into SaberTailor
- Export your SaberTailor settings back into the base game settings (keep in mind that the exported settings will no longer be independent for each hand)
- Mirror your SaberTailor settings to the opposite hand allowing for quick and easy configuration

## ControllerSettingsHelper Features
### THIS MOD IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL EVEN WITH SABER TAILOR TURNED OFF

A nifty tool to assist you in finding optimal controller settings
- Spawn in an Axis around your controllers that shows the 3 axis directions to help you align up your controllers with your natural swings
- Override the method in which the settings are applied to your controller. This is helpful if you are using/following Electrostats' [guide](https://bit.ly/ControllerSettingsFullGuide)
- Mirror Z axis while using base game settings since haha funny game broken (this is auto-disabled while SaberTailor is enabled)
